{description}

Almost all configuration for the SDK can be specified through the ConnectOptions which are passed to the `gocb.Connect` call in the SDK.  
In addition to this, as with SDK 2.0, the majority of these options can also be specified through the connection string.


== General Options

These options specify the general configuration options for the client.

Name: *Authenticator*::
+
Default:  `nil`
+
Set this to the authenticator you wish to use to authenticate with the server.  Possible
options which are included in the SDK include the PasswordAuthenticator and
CertificateAuthenticator.

Name: *Username / Password*::
+
Default:  `nil` / `nil`
+
Username and Password provide a shortcut to creating a PasswordAuthenticator which is
then used as an Authenticator for connecting to the Cluster.

Name: *Transcoder*::
+
Default:  `JSONTranscoder{}`
+
Transcoder specifies the transcoding behaviour that is required of the application.  By
default this is configured as a JSONTranscoder, which will encode all values through the
standard Go JSON marshalling facilities.

Name: *RetryStrategy*::
+
Default:  `BestEffortRetryStrategy{}`
+
The retry strategy decides if an operation should be retried or canceled. While implementing
a custom strategy is fairly advanced, the SDK ships with a best effort retry strategy
out of the box (BestEffortRetryStrategy). This default will retry the operation until it
either succeeds or the maximum request lifetime is reached.


== Security Options

By default the client will connect to Couchbase Server using an unencrypted connection.
If you are using the Enterprise Edition, it's possible to secure the connection using TLS
by specifying these options in conjunction with a `couchbase://` connecting string scheme.

Name: *TLSRootCAs*::
+
Default:  `nil`
+
TLSRootCAs enables the specification of the Root Certificate's to use when validating a
server certificate on the client-side.

Name: *TLSSkipVerify*::
+
Default:  `false`
+
This is an advanced option which can be used to disable TLS certificate validation.  This
will disable any form of server validation, but will still encrypt the data being settings
between the SDK and the server.  This option is intended strictly for use on older versions
of Couchbase Server where strict validation was not possible.


== Orphan Reporting Options

The Go SDK implements the ability to report when unexpected operation responses are received
from the server.  This primarily occurs when an operation is timed out and later received.

Name: *Disabled*::
+
Default:  `false`
+
Specifies whether orphan reporting should be disabled.

Name: *ReportInterval*::
+
Default:  `10s`
+
Specifies the duration between reporting of orphaned responses.

Name: *SampleSize*::
+
Default:  `10`
+
Specifies the number of samples of orphan responses that should be stored between reports.


== Circuit Breaker Options

The Go SDK provides a built in circuit breaker system to enable the SDK to more quickly
reject requests which are unlikely to succeed.

Name: *Disabled*::
+
Default:  `false`
+
...

Name: *VolumeThreshold*::
+
Default:  `20`
+
The volume threshold defines how many operations must be in the window before the
threshold percentage can be meaningfully calculated.

Name: *ErrorThresholdPercentage*::
+
Default:  `50`
+
The percentage of operations in a window that may fail before the circuit is
opened. The value is an integer in the range [0,100].

Name: *SleepWindow*::
+
Default:  `5s`
+
The delay between when the circuit opens and when the canary is tried.

Name: *RollingWindow*::
+
Default:  `1m`
+
How long the window is in which the number of failed ops are tracked in a rolling
fashion.

Name: *CanaryTimeout*::
+
Default:  `5s`
+
The period of time which canary operations are permitted to take before they are
marked as a failure.


== Timeout Options

Name: *ConnectTimeout*::
+
Default:  `10s`
+
The connect timeout is used when a Bucket is opened and if not overridden by a custom
timeout. If you feel the urge to change this value to something higher, there is a
good chance that your network is not properly set up. Connecting to the server should
in practice not take longer than a second on a reasonably fast network.

Name: *KVTimeout*::
+
Default:  `2.5s`
+
The Key/Value default timeout is used on operations which are performed on a specific
key if not overridden by a custom timeout. This includes all commands like get(),
getFromReplica() and all mutation commands, but does not include operations that are
performed with enhanced durability requirements.
+
TIP: xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#synchronous-writes[Durable Write operations] have their own timeout setting, `KVDurableTimeout`, see below.

Name: *KVDurableTimeout*::
+
Default: `10s`
+
Key/Value operations with enhanced durability requirements may take longer to complete, so they have a separate default timeout [From Go SDK 2.0.1].
+
WARNING: The `KVDurableTimeout` property is not part of the stable API and may change or be removed at any time.

Name: *ViewTimeout*::
+
Default:  `75s`
+
The View timeout is used on view operations if not overridden by a custom timeout.
Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it can affect
hundreds or thousands of rows. Also, if there is a node failure during the request
the internal cluster timeout is set to 60 seconds.

Name: *QueryTimeout*::
+
Default:  `75s`
+
The Query timeout is used on all N1QL query operations if not overridden by a custom
timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since it
can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: *AnalyticsTimeout*::
+
Default:  `75s`
+
The Analytics timeout is used on all Analytics query operations if not overridden by
a custom timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value
since it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: *SearchTimeout*::
+
Default:  `75s`
+
The Search timeout is used on all FTS operations if not overridden by a custom
timeout. Note that it is set to such a high timeout compared to key/value since
it can affect hundreds or thousands of rows.

Name: *ManagementTimeout*::
+
Default:  `75s`
+
The management timeout is used on all cluster management APIs (BucketManager,
UserManager, CollectionManager, QueryIndexManager, etc.) if not overridden by a custom
timeout. The default is quite high because some operations (such as flushing a bucket,
for example) might take a long time.


== IO Options

Name: *DisableMutationTokens*::
+
Default:  `false`
+
This is an advanced option which will disable the inclusion of mutation tokens in operation
responses from the server.  This should generally not be set.

Name: *DisableServerDurations*::
+
Default:  `false`
+
This is an advanced option which will disable the inclusion of server processing times in
operation responses from the server.  This should generally not be set.
