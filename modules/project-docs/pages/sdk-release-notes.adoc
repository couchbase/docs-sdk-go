Version 2.1.2 is a maintenance release for the Go SDK 2.1.0.

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2@v2.1.2?tab=doc[API Documentation]

=== New Features and Behavioral Changes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-907[GOCBC-907]:
Enhance search query errors to include the index name and error text from the server.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-913[GOCBC-913]:

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-923[GOCBC-923]:

=== Fixed Issues

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-879[GOCBC-879],
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-890[GOCBC-890]:
Fixed issue causing `Cluster` level operations to return errors when performed before underlying cluster or bucket connections are ready.
These operations (query, search, analytics, views, management APIs) will now behave like key value operations - waiting for connections to be ready before they are sent.
The https://docs.couchbase.com/go-sdk/2.1/howtos/managing-connections.html#waiting-for-bootstrap-completion[`WaitUntilReady`] call can still be used for verifying that connections are ready.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-891[GOCBC-891]:
Fixed issue where the `Name` property of a `Role` was being sent as the incorrect json field name.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-897[GOCBC-897]:
Fixed issue where operations with incredible short timeouts (timing out before operation sent) could cause a data race.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-900[GOCBC-900]:
Fixed issue where `IgnoreIfExists` option was being ignored for query index management.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-906[GOCBC-906]:
Fixed issue where enhanced durability could be incorrectly set as unsupported on early operations.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-914[GOCBC-914]:
Fixed issue where operations using named collections could be sent with an incorrect collection ID in queued before the collection is known.

== Known issues
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-941[GOCBC-941]:
Performing `Cluster` level `WaitUntilReady` never completes within the timeout.
This issue was introduced whilst fixing the behaviour for operations at the `Cluster` level when the `WaitUntilReady` call is not used.
The workaround for this is to not use the `Cluster` level `WaitUntilReady` call, `Cluster` level operations will now be queued until the SDK has connected and setup anyway.

== Version 2.1.1 (19 May 2020)

Version 2.1.1 is a maintenance release for the Go SDK 2.1.0.

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2@v2.1.1?tab=doc[API Documentation]

=== New Features and Behavioral Changes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-778[GOCBC-778]:
Updated legacy durability polling to use a backoff rather than a fixed interval.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-824[GOCBC-824]:
Enhanced timeout errors to contain more information and match up with the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0035-rto.md[Response Time Observability RFC].
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-828[GOCBC-828]:

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-691[GOCBC-691]:
Fixed issue where operations on unknown collections (when using 6.5 developer preview) are not automatically retried.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-757[GOCBC-757]:
Fixed issue where an array of arrays could cause a failure when using `Get` with `Projections`.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-882[GOCBC-882]:
Fixed issue where an invalid cluster config would trigger a shutdown of the underlying core SDK causing operations to fail.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-884[GOCBC-884]:
Fixed issue where `UpsertUser` sent an invalid request if a role was specified with no bucket.

=== Known issues

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-879[GOCBC-879], 
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-890[GOCBC-890]:
Performing `Cluster` level operations (query, search, management APIs) before underlying cluster or bucket connections are ready causes errors to be returned.
To mitigate this the `err := WaitUntilReady(time.Duration, WaitUntilReadyOptions)` operation can be used on either `Cluster` or `Bucket` which will either:
+
. Return no error if connections are setup and ready for use
. Return a `TimeoutError` if connections are not ready within the specified time limit.


== Version 2.1.0 (21 April 2020)

== Version 2.0.3 (17 March 2020)

Version 2.0.3 is a maintenance release for the Go SDK 2.0.0.

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2@v2.0.3?tab=doc[API Documentation]

=== New Features and Behavioral Changes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-662[GOCBC-662]:
The server requires that any subdoc xattr ops are at the beginning of the ops list. 
If the user provides an ops list containing subdoc xattr ops out of order, the SDK will now reorder it for them and then reorder it back again when it gets the result.
This ensures that `ContentAt` works as expected.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-700[GOCBC-700]:
Made improvements to errors returned from management operations.
They now provide more contextual information.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-716[GOCBC-716]:
SDK now returns a `FlushNotEnabled` error if bucket flush not enabled.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-719[GOCBC-719]:
SDK now consistently creates tracing spans for all HTTP requests.

Updated best effort retry strategy to use an exponential backoff calculator.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-820[GOCBC-820]:
Removed `context.Context` from search index manager operations.
Note that whilst this is a breaking change it was deemed best to break it and make sure any users who are using it know that they are using unused functionality.


=== Fixed Issues

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-814[GOCBC-814]:
Fixed issue where search was looking for incorrect field in the JSON response.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/GOCBC-817[GOCBC-817]:
