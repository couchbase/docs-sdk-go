= Migrating from Go SDK 1.x to SDK 2.x
:description: The SDK 3.x API used in Go SDK 2.x breaks the existing 2.x APIs (used in Go SDK 1.6) in order to provide a number of improvements.

{description}
Collections and Scopes are introduced.
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned values are now typically `Result` type objects.
Retry behaviour is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.
Individual behaviour changes across services are explained here.

Go SDK 2.x implements the SDK 3.x API found in the _3.x_ versions of the C, .NET, Java, PHP, and Python SDKs.

As an example here is a KeyValue document fetch:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=getresult,indent=0]

Compare this to a N1QL query:

===  Installation and Configuration

The Go SDK 2.x is available for download using the go modules system.  All releases are posted to the couchbase/gocb
GitHub repository and can be used by simply importing `github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2` and invoking `go get`.

IMPORTANT: Go SDK 2.x has a minimum required Go version of 1.13, although we recommend running the latest LTS version with the highest patch version available.

Almost all configuration for the SDK can be specified through the ConnectOptions which are passed to the
`gocb.Connect` call in the SDK.  In addition to this, as with SDK 2.0, the majority of these options can
also be specified through the connection string.  See the appropriate documentation for more information.

==== Authentication

Since Go SDK 1.x supports  Couchbase Server clusters older than 5.0, it had to support both Role-Based access control
as well as bucket-level passwords. The minimum cluster version supported by SDK 2.x is Server 5.0, which means that only
RBAC is supported. This is why you can set the username and password when directly connecting:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=basicconnecting,indent=0]
----

This is just shorthand for:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=passauthenticator,indent=0]
----

The reason why you can pass in a specific authenticator is that you can also use the same approach to configure certificate-based authentication:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=certauthenticator,indent=0]
----

Please see the documentation on certificate-based authentication for detailed information on how to configure this properly.


===  Connection Lifecycle

From a high-level perspective, bootstrapping and shutdown is very similar to Go 1.x. 
One notable difference is that the `Collection` is introduced and that the individual methods like `Bucket` immediately return, and cannot error. 
Compare SDK 2: the `OpenBucket` method would return an error if it could not open the bucket.

The reason behind this change is that even if a bucket can be opened, a millisecond later it may not be available any more. 
All this state has been moved into the actual operation so there is only a single place where the error handling needs to take place. 
This simplifies error handling and retry logic for an application.

In SDK 1, you connected, opened a bucket, performed a KV op, and disconnected like this:

[source,golang]
----
cluster, _ := gocb.Connect("127.0.0.1")
cluster.Authenticate(PasswordAuthenticator{
    Username: "user",
    Password: "pass"
})

bucket, _ := cluster.OpenBucket("travel-sample")

getResult, _ := bucket.Get("airline_10", nil)

bucket.Close()
----

Here is the SDK 2 equivalent:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=getcollection,indent=0]

include::example$migrating.go[tag=getresult,indent=0]

----

`Collections` are generally available from Couchbase Server version 7.0, which the SDK is already compatible with.
If you are using a Couchbase Server version which does not support `Collections`, always use the `DefaultCollection()` method to access the KV API; it will map to the full bucket.

IMPORTANT: You'll notice that `Bucket(string)` returns immediately, even if the bucket resources are not completely opened. 
This means that the subsequent `Get` operation may be dispatched even before the socket is open in the background. 
The SDK will handle this case transparently, and reschedule the operation until the bucket is opened properly. 
This also means that if a bucket could not be opened (say, because no server was reachable) the operation will time out.
Please check the logs to see the cause of the timeout (in this case, you'll see socket connect rejections).

Also note, you will now find Query, Search, and Analytics at the `Cluster` level.
This is where they logically belong.
If you are using Couchbase Server 6.5 or later, you will be able to perform cluster-level queries even if no bucket is open. 
If you are using an earlier version of the cluster you must open at least one bucket, otherwise cluster-level queries will fail.


=== Serialization and Transcoding

In SDK 2 the main method to control transcoding was through specfying unique Transcoder instances at the top-level.  This concept
has been extended to enable developers to specify per-operation Transcoder instances.

Additionally, the default transcoder has been modified to no longer transcoder byte-arrays as a precaution against accidentally
encoding strings as JSON or JSON as strings.  A new LegacyTranscoder has been implemented which mirrors Go SDK 1.x's behaviour.


=== Encryption

Field Level Encryption is a separate library requiring, for Go SDK 2.x, SDK 2.2.0 or more recent. 
Differences between the 1.x and 2.x implementations, and an upgrade path, are discussed in the xref:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc#migration-from-sdk1[Field-Level Encryption documentation].


===  Error Handling

How to handle errors has remained relatively unchanged from Go SDK 1.x and continues to follow the idiomatic Go ideology of
returning errors via a parameter.

However in Go SDK 2.x, we have updated our code to follow the latest Go error handling best practices and provide an improved
error interface using the `errors.As` and `errors.Is` methods.

In version 1.x of the SDK, you may receive an error and compare it directly to one of the `gocb.ErrSomething` errors:

[source,golang]
----
res, err := bucket.Get("airline_10", nil)
if err == gocb.ErrKeyNotFound {
  // handle the error
}
----

In version 2.x of the SDK, you should instead now check using the `errors.Is` method:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=handleerror,indent=0]
----

In addition, 2.x of the SDK provides the ability to gather additional contextual information about
why your operation failed through the various error types:

[source,golang]
----
include::example$migrating.go[tag=handleerrorext,indent=0]
----
