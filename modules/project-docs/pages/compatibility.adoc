{description}

In line with the https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy[Golang project], we support both the current, and the previous, versions of Go.
At time of writing (March 2024), this is 1.21 and 1.22.
Older versions may remain compatible, but are not supported.


== Platform Compatibility

=== OS Compatibility

The {name-sdk} is tested and supported on the following OSs and platforms:

****
[discrete]
=== GNU/Linux

* Amazon Linux 2 & AL2023.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 & 9;
* Oracle Linux 8 & 9.
* Ubuntu (LTS) 20.04 (_Focal_) & 22.04 (_Jammy_).
* Debian 10 (_Buster_), 11 (_Bullseye_), and Debian 12 (_Bookworm_).
* SUSE Enterprise Linux 12 & 15
* Alpine Linux 3.18 (_Oracle JDK only_).
// -- but see <<alpine-linux-compatibility, workaround note below>>.

[discrete]
=== Microsoft Windows

* Microsoft Windows 10 & 11;
* Windows Server 2019 & 2022.

[discrete]
=== Mac OS X

The current and previous two releases of OS X.
At time of writing (March 2024): 14 (Sonoma), 13 (Ventura), and 12 (Monterey).
M1 ARM  architecture is fully supported in the Scala SDK.

[discrete]
=== ARM Processor Support

AWS Amazon Graviton2, Apple M1 ARM processors, and ARMv8 on Ubuntu 20.04+ (from SDK 1.4).
****

The Go SDK should also be expected to run on other commonly-available GNU/Linux distributions which support the Go platform, but not all combinations can be tested.
//-- notable exceptions are listed below.

////
==== Alpine Linux Compatibility

The https://netty.io[Netty] I/O library used by our JVM SDKs supports native optimizations to achieve higher throughput and lower latency 
-- which the SDK enables by default. 
Those modules are compiled against `glibc` and Alpine Linux uses `musl` instead --
so the {name-sdk} is unable to complete bootstrapping on this platform.

Because Alpine Linux does not have the `glibc` support needed,
we highly recommend that you seek an alternative distribution where possible. 
If that is not a option, then a possible workaround that can be applied is as follows:

* Disable the native IO:
+
[source,toml]
====
ClusterEnvironment env = ClusterEnvironment.builder().ioEnvironment(IoEnvironment.enableNativeIo(false)).build();
====

* Disable it in Netty itself via the following system property:
`-Dcom.couchbase.client.core.deps.io.netty.transport.noNative=true`

The downside of these workarounds is potentially reduced performance, which can be determined through benchmarking and profiling.

== Couchbase Server Compatibility


Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.

=== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Scala SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*: This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

Note the https://www.couchbase.com/support-policy[End of Life dates^] for Couchbase Server and SDK versions.
See the notes there for Support details.

=== Capella Compatibility

At time of release, the Couchbase {go-current-version} Go SDK is fully compatible with Couchbase Capella, our fully-hosted database-as-a-service. 
To make development easier, the {go-current-version} SDK includes the Capella client certificate ready installed.
