== Preparation

As well as the xref:start-using-sdk.adoc[Go SDK 2.0] and Couchbase Server, 
set up as described above, you will need `git` to fetch the travel sample application code:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-golang.git
----

Change directory into your cloned repository, and check out the `6.5` branch (this will most probably be enabled as the default branch).

[source,console]
----
$ cd try-cb-golang
----

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout 6.5
----


== Running the Travel Sample Application

Next, edit the `cbConnStr` field in *main.go* to the one for your containerised Couchbase Server (or localhost, 127.0.0.1, if appropriate), and any other local changes -- such as password.
From here onwards, we'll assume the defaults.

And run with

[source,console]
----
$ go run main.go
----

After the build, with your Web browser of choice, head to port 8080 of the local machine -- http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080].

== Using the Sample App

Give yourself a username and password and click *Register*.

Now try out a few queries, and see Search in action for the hotel finder feature..


== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase Go SDK in action with Query and Search,
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the Go SDK.

Here's the Search code, where `AirportSearch` checks to see whether the search term is a three or four letter FAA or ICAO abbreviation, and if not searches for it as an airport name:

[source,golang]
----
func AirportSearch(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	var respData jsonAirportSearchResp

	searchKey := req.FormValue("search")

	var queryStr string
	if len(searchKey) == 3 {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE faa='%s'", strings.ToUpper(searchKey))
	} else if len(searchKey) == 4 && searchKey == strings.ToUpper(searchKey) {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE icao ='%s'", searchKey)
	} else {
		queryStr = fmt.Sprintf("SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE airportname like '%s%%'", searchKey)
	}

	respData.Context.Add(queryStr)
	rows, err := globalCluster.Query(queryStr, nil)
	if err != nil {
		writeJsonFailure(w, 500, err)
		return
	}

	respData.Data = []jsonAirport{}
	var airport jsonAirport
	for rows.Next(&airport) {
		respData.Data = append(respData.Data, airport)
		airport = jsonAirport{}
	}

	encodeRespOrFail(w, respData)
}
----

The https://github.com/Danzibob/try-cb-golang/blob/6.5/main.go[main.go] file also contains the functions for handling users, registration, and N1QL queries -- which you may find instructive for putting together your first Couchbase applications in Go.



== Data Model

See the xref:ref:travel-app-data-model.adoc[Travel App Data Model] reference page for more information about the sample data set used.
