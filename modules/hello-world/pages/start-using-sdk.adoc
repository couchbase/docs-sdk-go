== Hello Couchbase

On this page we show you how to quickly get up and running -- installing the Couchbase Go SDK, and trying out the Hello World code example against Couchbase Capella, or against a local Couchbase cluster.

We will go through the code sample step by step, but for those in a hurry to see it, here it is:

[{tabs}] 
==== 
Couchbase Capella Sample::
+
--
To connect to xref:cloud::index.adoc[Couchbase Capella], be sure to get the correct endpoint as well as user, password and bucket name.

[source,go]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tags=**]
----
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+ 
-- 
[source.try-it,go]
----
include::example$startusing.go[tags=**]
----

As well as the Go SDK (see below), and a running instance of Couchbase Server, you will need to load up the Travel Sample Bucket
using either the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface]
or the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[command line].
--
====

The Couchbase Capella free trial version comes with the Travel Sample Bucket, and its Query indexes, loaded and ready.


== Quick Installation

Version 2 of the Go SDK has added support for https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go Modules]. 
You can use `go get` to download the SDK:

[source,console]
----
$ go get github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2@v2.5.0
----

More details on installation can be found xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[here].

NOTE: In line with the https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy[Golang project], we support both the current, and the previous, versions of Go.

== Step by Step

At this point we want to transition from the terminal to your code editor of choice.

Let's now create an empty file named `main.go` and walk through adding code step-by-step:

* Connect to a single node cluster, bucket, and collection;
* Add and retrieve a new document;
* Look up (SQL-type query) the new document by attribute value.

=== Prerequisites

Here are all of the imports that you will need to run the sample code.

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tags=imports,indent=0]
----

Now, create an empty `main()` function.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
func main() {
	// add code here...
}
----

We will update this function as we go along the steps in this guide.

=== Connection

The basic connection details that you'll need are given below -- for more background information, refer to the xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc#connection-strings[Managing Connections page].

In the `main()` function, add the following:

[tabs]
====
Couchbase Capella::
+
--
IMPORTANT: Couchbase Capella requires mandatory use of TLS (Transport Layer Security).
As of Go SDK version 2.5.0, the standard certificate required to connect to a Capella cluster is automatically included with no additional configuration.

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

Couchbase Capella uses xref:cloud:organizations:organization-projects-overview.adoc[Roles] to control user access to database resources.
For the purposes of this example, we can use the _Organization Owner_ role automatically assigned to a user account during installation of the Capella cluster.
This role grants full access to a Capella organization, including full data access to all projects and clusters.
In a production scenario, we strongly recommend setting up users with more granular access roles as a best practice. 

For the SDK client to access cluster data, you will need to set up credentials for your database by xref:cloud:get-started:cluster-and-data.adoc#credentials[following these steps].

--
Local Couchbase Server::
+
--
[source,golang]
----
include::example$startusing.go[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

Couchbase uses xref:7.1@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
For the purposes of this example, we are connecting to Couchbase using the _Full Admin_ role created during the installation of our Couchbase Server.

Couchbase RBAC is fully described in the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups, and Roles] page.
--
====

Following successful authentication, the bucket can be opened:

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=bucket,indent=0]
----

NOTE: We are working with the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[travel-sample] data bucket. 
If you are not, update the `bucketName` variable used in the example with your own.

The {go-current-version} SDK supports full integration with the xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] feature introduced in Couchbase Server 7.0.
_Collections_ allow documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to a specified _Scope_.
Here we will use the `users` collection within the `tenant_agent_00` scope from `travel-sample` bucket as an example.

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=collection,indent=0]
----

The code shows how you would use a named collection and scope. 
A named or default collection will provide the same functionality as bucket-level operations did in previous versions of Couchbase Server.

The `DefaultCollection` must be used when connecting to a 6.6 cluster or earlier.

=== Document Addition and Retrieval

Let's create a struct in our application that we can add to our `travel-sample` bucket that conforms to the structure of a document of type user.

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=document,indent=0]
----

xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Document operations], such as storing and retrieving documents, can be done using `Collection.Upsert()` and `Collection.Get()`.
Simply pass the key (and value, if applicable) to the relevant methods.

The following function will _upsert_ a document into the database:

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=upsert,indent=0]
----

Now, let's retrieve that document using a key-value operation. 
The following function runs a get for a document key and logs out the result in our console:

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=get,indent=0]
----

=== SQL++ Lookup

Couchbase N1QL queries are performed by invoking `Cluster.Query()`.
In the code below we will query Couchbase to retrieve users with a particular interest and print the results.

[source,golang]
----
include::devguide:example$go/cloud.go[tag=query,indent=0]
----

=== Execute!

Now we can run our code using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ go run main.go
----

The results you should expect are as follows:

[source,console]
----
User: {Arthur kingarthur@couchbase.com [Holy Grail African Swallows]}
map[name:Arthur]
----

== Next Steps

Now you're up and running, try one of the following:

// Should search and analytics be removed?

* Our xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample Application] demonstrates all the basics you need to know;
* Explore xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Key Value Operations] (CRUD) against a document database;
* Or xref:howtos:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query] with our SQL-based N1QL language;
// * Try longer-running queries with our xref:howtos:analytics-using-sdk.adoc[Analytics Service];
// * A xref:howtos:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Full Text Search];
* Or read up on xref:concept-docs:data-services.adoc[which service fits your use case].

=== Additional Resources

The API reference is generated for each release and can be found https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/couchbase/gocb/v2[here].
Older API references are linked from their respective sections in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes].

xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[The Migrating from SDK2 API (Go 1.x) to API 3 page (Go 2.x SDK)] highlights the main differences to be aware of when migrating your code.

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Go SDK.
The Go SDK source code is available on https://github.com/couchbase/gocb[GitHub].

=== Troubleshooting

* Couchbase Server is designed to work in the same WAN or availability zone as the client application.
If you're running the SDK on your laptop against a Capella cluster, see further information on:
** Notes on xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[Constrained Network Environments].
** xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[Network Requirements].
** If you have a consumer-grade router which has problems with DNS-SRV records review our xref:howtos:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc#troubleshooting-host-not-found[Troubleshooting Guide].
* Our https://forums.couchbase.com/c/go-sdk/23[community forum] is a great source of help.
