// [abstract]
// The C++ Transactions built upon the C SDK.


Distributed ACID Transactions are not currently available for the Go SDK.
Nevertheless, you may find that you can achieve the same result with our xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[strong durable gurarantees within a single bucket] and some re-architecture.


Currently, Distributed ACID Transactions are available for:

* The xref:1.0@cxx-txns::distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[C++ API].
* The xref:3.0@java-sdk:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[Java SDK].
