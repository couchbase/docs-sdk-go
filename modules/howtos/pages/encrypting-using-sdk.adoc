== Packaging
The Go SDK works together with the https://github.com/couchbase/gocbencryption[Go Couchbase Encryption^] library to provide support for encryption and decryption of JSON fields.
This library includes cryptographic algorithms you can use out of the box, and provides a framework for implementing your own crypto components.

NOTE: The encryption code is packaged as an optional library and is subject to the Couchbase https://www.couchbase.com/LA03012021[License] and https://www.couchbase.com/ESLA08042020[Enterprise Subscription License] agreements.
To use the encryption library, you have to explicitly include this dependency in your project configuration.

To get started with the Go encryption library you can fetch it using:

[source,console]
----
$ go get github.com/couchbase/gocbencryption/v2.0.0
----

== Configuration
The Go Field-Level Encryption library works on the principle of `Encrypters` and `Decrypters` which can be packaged within a `Provider`, as well as a custom xref:transcoders-nonjson.adoc[`Transcoder`].
`Encrypters` and `Decrypters` are registered with a `CryptoManager` and are then used at serialization/deserialization time to encrypt and decrypt annotated fields.

Here we'll go through an example of setting up and using the Go Field-Level Encryption library.

To begin we need to create a couple of keys, you should *not* use the `InsecureKeyring` other than for evaluation purposes and should keep your keys secure.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=keys]
----

Now that we have keys we can create a `Provider` (here we use the `AeadAes256CbcHmacSha512` algorithm which is the default supplied by the library).
The `Provider` gives us a way to easily create multiple encrypters for the same algorithm but different keys.
At this point we also create `CryptoManager` and register our encrypters and decrypters with it.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=provider]
----

Now we can create a `Transcoder` using our `CryptoManager`.
Once created we need to register the `Transcoder` with the SDK.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=transcoder]
----

== Usage
Once an encryption transcoder has been registered then encryption/decryption will be performed on annotated fields transparently.

Sensitive fields in your data classes can be "annotated" using the `encrypted` tag. For example:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=annotation]
----

Now let's create a person document and save it to Couchbase:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=upsert]
----

You can get the document as a `map[string]interface{}` to verify the fields were encrypted:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=getmap]
----

Because decoding as a `map` does not decrypt anything, the expected output is something like:

[source]
----
map[
    address:map[
        encrypted$houseName:map[alg:AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512 ciphertext:Uh1WE0VSkjZoc4x9xITQ0sHm1eGqJszzv7/YuvLapGOjmSHj3+DNsTYKylKyhZMeDW6zosmm+F7qV+OO6+1WFg== kid:mykey]
        streetName:my street
    ]
    encrypted$password:map[alg:AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512 ciphertext:C2l9bJKjnDpgaOUh4R0+SKAPE8WjFoxR8BvIolpB9w467yEspmZmqXcTCHkFk29O1F8sac9V9asb1lWS0ZgI3w== kid:mykey]
    firstName:Barry
    lastName:Sheen
    encrypted$phone:map[alg:AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512 ciphertext:N2HpOioi3bm4Q9s0H4aon9NX1QO+7ZKs4DkEfy2ExeuVrMCfb14wrq3kpN7BfOOWo7YnFUt/kx/xgJEv2cOFDw== kid:myotherkey]
]
----

Now let's read the person document using the data binding.

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=getstr]
----

The output is now:

[source]
----
{FirstName:Barry LastName:Sheen Password:bang! Address:{HouseName:my house StreetName:my street} Phone:123456}
----

[#migration-from-sdk1]
== Migrating from SDK 1

WARNING: SDK 1 cannot read fields encrypted by SDK 2.

It's inadvisable to have both the old and new versions of your application active at the same time.
The simplest way to migrate is to do an offline upgrade during a scheduled maintenance window.
For an online upgrade without downtime, consider a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment[blue-green deployment^].

SDK 2 requires additional configuration to read fields encrypted by SDK 1.
The rest of this section describes how to configure Field-Level Encryption in SDK 2 for backwards compatibility with SDK 1.

[#configure-field-name-prefix]
=== Changing the field name prefix

In SDK 1, the default prefix for encrypted field names was `\__crypt_`.
This caused problems for Couchbase Sync Gateway, which does not like field names to begin with an underscore.
In SDK 2, the default prefix is `encrypted$`.

For compatibility with SDK 1, you can configure the `CryptoManager` to use the old `\__crypt_` prefix:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/fle.go[tag=oldannotation]
----

Alternatively, you can https://forums.couchbase.com/t/replacing-field-name-prefix/28786[rename the existing fields using a N1QL statement].

WARNING: In SDK 1, only top-level fields could be encrypted.
SDK 2 allows encrypting fields at any depth.
If you decide to rename the existing fields, make sure to do so _before_ writing any encrypted fields below the top level, otherwise it may be difficult to rename the nested fields using a generic N1QL statement.


[#configure-legacy-decrypters]
=== Enabling decrypters for legacy algorithms

The encryption algorithms used by SDK 1 are deprecated, and are no longer used for encrypting new data.
To enable decrypting fields written by SDK 1, register the legacy decrypters with the `CryptoManager`:
