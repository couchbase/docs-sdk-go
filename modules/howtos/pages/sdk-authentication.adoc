Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide covered the basics for authorizing against a Couchbase cluster, but you may need to use alternative authentication methods such as Certification.


== RBAC

Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide introduced basic authentication against a Couchbase cluster:

== Authenticating the Go Client by Certificate

For sample procedures whereby certificates can be generated and deployed, see xref:7.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].
The rest of this document assumes that the processes there, or something similar, have been followed.
That is:

* A cluster certificate has been created and installed on the server.
* A client certificate and private key pair have been created, and are accessible to be loaded into your application (the example below loads them from the file system).
