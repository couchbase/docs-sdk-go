== User-Management APIs

Users who have been assigned the *Admin* role for the cluster are able to create, edit, and remove users.
The Java SDK provides APIs to support these activities.
A high-level summary of the APIs can be found in xref:concept-docs:sdk-user-management-overview.adoc[User-Management],
and details of all options in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client/com/couchbase/client/java/manager/user/UserManager.html[UserManager API docs].

== Using the UserManager API

The most common uses of the `UserManager` API are creating and listing users:

.Listing Users

include::devguide:example$go/user-management.go[tag=getall]
----

Using a user created in the SDK to access data:
