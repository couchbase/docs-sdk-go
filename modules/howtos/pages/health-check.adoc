[abstract]
In today's distributed and virtual environments, users will often not have full administrative control over their whole network. 
Health Check introduces _Ping_ to check nodes are still healthy, and to force idle connections to be kept alive in environments with eager shutdowns of unused resources.
_Diagnostics_ requests a report from a node, giving instant health check information.
