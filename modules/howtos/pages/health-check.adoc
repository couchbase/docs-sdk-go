{description}
Health Check introduces _Ping_ to check nodes are still healthy, and to force idle connections to be kept alive in environments with eager shutdowns of unused resources.
_Diagnostics_ requests a report from a node, giving instant health check information.


Diagnosing problems in distributed environments is far from easy, so Couchbase provides a _Health Check API_ with `Ping()` for active monitoring  and `Diagnostics()` for a look at what the client believes is the current state of the cluster.
More extensive discussion of the uses of Health Check can be found in the xref:concept-docs:health-check.adoc[Health Check Concept Guide].


== Ping

At its simplest, `ping` provides information about the current state of the connections in the Couchbase Cluster, by actively polling:
`Ping` is available at the `Cluster` and `Bucket` object levels.
Below we use it at the `Bucket` level:

<.> ReportID is optional and assigns a name to this report, if empty then a uuid will be assigned.
<.> ServiceTypes are which services to ping against.
<.> The report can be marshalled down into JSON in a human friendly format.

== Diagnostics

`Diagnostics` returns a list of the nodes that the SDK currently has (or had) a connection to, and the current status of the connection.
However this call _does not_ actively poll the nodes, reporting instead the state the last time it tried to access each node.
If you want the _current_ status, then use xref:#Ping[Ping].

As the Go SDK does not hold long lived HTTP connections the `Diagnostics` operation will only return information about connections to the KeyValue service.
