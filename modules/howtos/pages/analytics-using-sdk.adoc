{description}

For complex and long-running queries, involving large ad hoc join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations, Couchbase Data Platform offers the xref:6.6@server:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)].
This is the analytic counterpart to our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[operational data focussed Query Service].
The analytics service is available in Couchbase Data Platform 6.0 and later (developer preview in 5.5).


== Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with our xref:6.5@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer],
in particular creating a dataset and linking it to a bucket to shadow the operational data,
try Couchbase Analytics using the Go SDK.
Intentionally, the API for analytics is very similar to that of the query service.
In these examples we will be using an `airports` dataset created on the `travel-sample` bucket.

In Go SDK 1.x, Analytics was only available on the `Bucket` object;
in Go SDK 2.0, Analytics queries are submitted using the Cluster reference, not a Bucket or Collection:

NOTE: When using a Couchbase version < 6.5 you must create a valid Bucket connection using `cluster.Bucket(name)` before you can use Analytics.

== Queries

A query can either be `simple` or be `parameterized`. If parameters are used, they can either be `positional` or `named`.
Here is one example of each:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-simple-query.go[tag=simple]
----

The query may be performed with positional parameters:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-positional-placeholders.go[tag=positional]
----

Alternatively, the query may be performed with named parameters:

[source,golang,indent=0]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-named-placeholders.go[tag=named]
----

NOTE: As timeouts are propagated to the server by the client, a timeout set on the client side may be used to stop the processing of a request, in order to save system resources.
See example in the next section.


== Options

Additional parameters may be sent as part of the query.
There are currently three parameters:

* *Client Context ID*, sets a context ID that is returned back as part of the result.
Uses `ClientContextID string` default is a random UUID
* *Timeout*, customizes the timeout sent to the server.
Does not usually have to be set, as the client sets it based on the timeout on the operation.
Uses `Timeout time.Duration`, and defaults to the Analytics timeout set on the client (75s).
This can be adjusted at the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#timeout-options[cluster global config level].
* *Priority*, set if the request should have priority over others.
The `Priority bool` option defaults to `false`.

Here, we give the request priority over others, and set a custom, server-side timeout value:

== Handling the Response

These query results may contain various sorts of data and metadata,
depending upon the nature of the query,
as you will have seen when working through our xref:6.5@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer].

Results are iterated using the `Next` function.
Within the `for` loop the result is read using the `Row` by supplying a pointer to the variable in which to store the value.
Always remember to check the error value of `Err` after iterating the results, this is where any errors occurring whilst calling `Next` will be returned.

// Move these to Error reference doc?
Common errors are listed in our xref:ref:error-codes.adoc#analytics-errors[Errors Reference doc], with errors caused by resource unavailability (such as timeouts and _Operation cannot be performed during rebalance_ messages) leading to an xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc#retry[automatic retry] by the SDK.

If you only expect a single result or only want to use the first result in a resultset then you can use `One`
(note: this function will iterate any remaining rows in the resultset so can only be called once and should only be used on small resultsets):

=== MetaData

The `AnalyticsResultsMetadata` object contains useful metadata, such as `Metrics` and `ClientContextID`.
Note that before metadata can be accessed the results object must be closed.
Here is a snippet using several items of metadata

include::devguide:example$go/analytics-simple-query.go[tag=metadata]

For a listing of available `Metrics` in `MetaData`, see the xref:concept-docs:analytics-for-sdk-users.adoc[Understanding Analytics] SDK doc.


== Scoped Queries on Named Collections

In addition to creating a dataset with a WHERE clause to filter the results to documents with certain characteristics, you can also create a dataset against a named collection, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
ALTER COLLECTION `travel-sample`.inventory.airport ENABLE ANALYTICS;

-- NB: this is more or less equivalent to:
CREATE DATAVERSE `travel-sample`.inventory;
CREATE DATASET `travel-sample`.inventory.airport ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airport;
----

We can then query the Dataset as normal, using the fully qualified keyspace:

[source,go]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-collection-scope.go[tag=handle-collection,indent=0]
----

Note that using the `CREATE DATASET` syntax we could choose any Dataset name in any Dataverse, including the default.
However the SDK supports this standard convention, allowing us to query from the Scope object:

[source,go]
----
include::devguide:example$go/analytics-collection-scope.go[tag=handle-scope,indent=0]
----
