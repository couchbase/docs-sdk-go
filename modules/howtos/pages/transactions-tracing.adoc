//If configured, detailed telemetry on each transaction can be output that is compatible with various external systems including OpenTelemetry and its predecessor OpenTracing.
//This telemetry is particularly useful for monitoring performance.
//
//See the xref:howtos:observability-tracing.adoc[SDK Request Tracing documentation] for how to configure this.
//
//// TODO: Check if this is still the case?
//Tracing should currently be regarded as 'developer preview' functionality, as the spans and attributes output may change over time.
//
//== Parent Spans
//
//The application may wish to indicate that the transaction is part of a larger span -- for instance, a user request.
//It can do this by passing that as a parent span.
//
//This can be done using the SDK's `RequestTracer` abstraction as so:
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=tracing,indent=0]
//----
//
//Or if you have an existing OpenTelemetry span you can easily convert it to a Couchbase `RequestSpan` and pass it to the SDK:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=tracing-wrapped,indent=0]
//----
