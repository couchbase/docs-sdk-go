{description}
The 3.0 API SDKs (including Go SDK 2.0.x) all work with Collections and Scopes.
As a practical demonstration, we have a collections-enabled version of the Travel Sample application.

The xref:6.5@server:developer-preview:collections/collections-overview.adoc[Developer Preview of the upcoming Collections feature] in Couchbase Server is fully implemented in the 3.0 API versions of the Couchbase SDKs.
When working with other server versions, the `defaultcollection` is used from the SDK.
Here we show how to access individual collections in the Developer Preview version of Couchbase Server 6.5, with a collections-enabled version of our xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample application].
User documents and flight documents are split into user and flight collections.
Something that previously had to be done with key-value references to different types or categories of data.


== Travel Sample app -- with Collections

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$sample-application.adoc[tag=prereq]

[WARNING]
====
Enabling Developer Preview should only be done on a development machine; 
there is no upgrade path available from a DP-enabled Couchbase Server.
====
== Preparation

As well as the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Go SDK 2.1] and Couchbase Server, 
set up as described above, you will need `git` to fetch the travel sample application code:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-golang.git
----

Change directory into your cloned repository, and check out the _Collections_ branch (in the case of the Go SDK, `6.5-collections`).

[source,console]
----
$ cd try-cb-golang
----

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout 6.5-collections
----

* Before building the Collections-enabled version of the Travel Sample Application, you need to enable this DP feature (see warning above).
+
[source,console]
.Enable Collections Developer Preview
----
$ /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli enable-developer-preview --enable -c http://localhost:8091 -u Administrator -p password
----
+
[source,console]
----
Developer preview cannot be disabled once it is enabled. If you enter developer preview mode you will not be able to upgrade. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

The Travel Sample Bucket needs altering to be split into collections. 
There is a script to do this included with the collections branch of the Travel Sample App -- run:

[source,console]
.Create Sample Collections
----
$ sh create-collections.sh Administrator password 127.0.0.1
----

Adjusting for any changes you have made to server URL, or admin password.
You should now have the Travel Sample Data Bucket split into collections:

----
{"uid":"1"}{"uid":"2"}{"uid":"3"}

THE FINAL RESULT
{"uid":"3","scopes":[{"name":"userData","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"flights","uid":"9"},{"name":"users","uid":"8"}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----


== Running the Travel Sample Application


Next, edit the `cbConnStr` field in *main.go* to the one for your containerised Couchbase Server (or localhost, 127.0.0.1, if appropriate), and any other local changes -- such as password.
From here onwards, we'll assume the defaults.

And run with

[source,console]
----
$ go run main.go
----

After the build, with your Web browser of choice, head to port 8080 of the local machine -- http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080].

Using the Sample _App_ is the same as with the non-collections version that we cover xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc#using-the-sample-app[in our introductory doc], but we're assuming you've come here to see Collections in use in the codebase.


== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase Node.js SDK in action with Query and Search, 
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the Node.js SDK.

Collections and Scope are set immediately after opening the bucket in `main()`:

[source,golang]
----
// Open the bucket
globalBucket = globalCluster.Bucket(cbDataBucket, nil)
userBucket = globalCluster.Bucket(cbUserBucket, nil)

// Select the required collections
globalCollection = globalBucket.DefaultCollection()
userDataScope := userBucket.Scope("userData")
userCollection = userDataScope.Collection("users")
flightCollection = userDataScope.Collection("flights")
----

And operations are now performed on the specific collection, rather than the whole bucket (or the whole bucket via `_default` collection, as in Server 6.5 without the Developer Preview enabled).

[source,golang]
----
var flight jsonBookedFlight
var flights []jsonBookedFlight
for _, flightID := range flightIDs {
	res, err := flightCollection.Get(flightID, nil)
	if err != nil {
		writeJsonFailure(w, 500, err)
		return
	}
	res.Content(&flight)
	flights = append(flights, flight)
}
