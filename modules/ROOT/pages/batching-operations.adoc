== Batching operations using SDK

The following code generates a number of fake documents and inserts them in one batch. It does this by building up a list of `BulkOps` which are then executed using the `Do` command on the bucket. Take note of the `op.Err` field which is populated if there was an error during `Do`.

// Generate a number of bulk upsert ops
type simpleDoc struct {
    counter int
    name    string
}
numDocs := 100
var ops []gocb.BulkOp
for i := 0; i < numDocs; i++ {
    doc := simpleDoc{
        counter: i,
        name:    "Foo Bar",
    }
    op := gocb.UpsertOp{
        Key:   fmt.Sprintf("%d", i),
        Value: doc,
    }
    ops = append(ops, &op)
}

// Execute the bulk ops
err = bucket.Do(ops)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

for i := 0; i < len(ops); i++ {
    op := ops[i].(*gocb.UpsertOp)
    fmt.Println(op.Key, op.Value, op.Err)
}
