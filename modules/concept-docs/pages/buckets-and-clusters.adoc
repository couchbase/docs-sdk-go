[abstract]
The Couchbase Go SDK provides an API for managing a Couchbase cluster programmatically.

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$clusters-buckets.adoc[tag=management]

////
Management operations in the Go SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `buckets()` call on the cluster:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "user", "123456");
BucketManager manager = cluster.buckets();
manager.createBucket(bucketSettings);
----

// The `BucketSettings` can be created via a builder, [.api]`DefaultBucketSettings.builder()`.
This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.getBucket(string)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.updateBucket(bucketSettings)`). 

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
