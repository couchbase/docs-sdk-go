Management operations in the Go SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:


== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, call the bucket manager with the `Buckets()` call on the cluster:

[source,golang]
----
manager := cluster.Buckets()
err = mgr.CreateBucket(createBucketSettings)
----

This class is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.GetBucket(string, *gocb.GetBucketOptions)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.UpdateBucket(gocb.BucketSettings, *gocb.UpdateBucketOptions)`).

The default Collection & Default Scope will be used automatically.
