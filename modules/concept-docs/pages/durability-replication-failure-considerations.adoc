{description}
Even the most reliable software and hardware might fail at some point, and along with the failures, introduce a chance of data loss.
Couchbaseâ€™s durability features include Synchronous Replication, and the possibility to use distributed, multi-document ACID transactions.
It is the responsibility of the development team and the software architect to evaluate the best choice for each use case.

Options for making changes to `numKvConnections` (kvEndpoints) for Durable Writes, change the `kv_pool_size` value. 
Increasing the number of reader and writer threads for Couchbase Server storage _may_ be advantageous: see the discussion on the xref:7.1@server:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc#threading[Server storage page].
