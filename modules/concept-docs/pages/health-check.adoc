{description}

`Ping` and `diagnostics` methods, on the bucket and cluster objects respectively, can give us information about the current state of nodes, and their connections.

== Uses

'Ping` provides a raw JSON payload suitable for feeding into reactive log and aggregation components, including monitoring systems like _Splunk_, _ElasticSearch_, and _Nagios_.
It can also help keep connections alive if you are operating across an environment which aggressively closes down unused connections.

`Diagnostics` provides a strongly typed API for proactive, pull-based monitoring systems, such as:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probes via HTTP or CLI commands].
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck[Docker Health Check with CLI commands].
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html[AWS ELB through HTTP].

This API does not provide binary yes/no answers about the health of the cluster; rather it summarizes as much information as possible, for the application developer to assemble a complete, contextual view and come to a conclusion.

Note: `Ping` may reopen a connection, so is not without side-effects.
`Diagnostics` shows what the SDK _perceives_ as the current state of the network and services -- it is without side-effects, but may not be up to date.


== Ping

`Ping` _actively_ queries the status of the specified services,giving status and latency information for every node reachable.
In addition to its use as a monitoring tool, a regular `Ping` can be used in an environment which does not respect keep alive values for a connection.

The return value is a `PingResult` containing detail about the report including a `services` field.
The `services` field is a map of service type (e.g. `ServiceTypeKeyValue` or `ServiceTypeQuery`) to the value containing latency and status information.
The report also supports being exported to JSON for purposes such as logging.

<.> ReportID is optional and assigns a name to this report, if empty then a uuid will be assigned.
<.> ServiceTypes are which services to ping against.
<.> The report can be marshalled down into JSON in a human friendly format.

The output from exporting to JSON could look like:

      }
    ]
  }
}

== Diagnostics

`Diagnostics` returns a list of the nodes that the SDK currently has (or had) a connection to, and the current status of the connection.
However this call _does not_ actively poll the nodes, reporting instead the state the last time it tried to access each node.
If you want the _current_ status, then use xref:#ping[Ping].
